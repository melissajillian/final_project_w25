    <div class="summary">
        <p>
            <em>Arcane</em> is not just a narrative triumph, it's a masterclass in visual storytelling. Every frame is meticulously crafted to convey emotion, character development, and thematic depth without needing a single word. From color palettes and lighting to symbolic imagery and environmental design, the show uses its visuals to speak volumes.

            <h3 class="caption-title"><strong>Color as Emotional Language</strong></h3>
            <p>Color is one of the most powerful storytelling tools in <em>Arcane.</em> Different tones, hues, and lighting choices reflect emotional states, power dynamics, and thematic contrasts between characters and environments.</p><br>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Zaun vs. Piltover:</strong> Zaun is bathed in murky greens, sickly yellows, and grimy shadows - a visual representation of toxicity, struggle, and industrial decay. In contrast, Piltover gleams with golds, blues, and natural light, reinforcing its status, wealth, and perceived superiority.</li><br>
                <li><strong>Jinx's Palette:</strong> Jinx's world is awash in neons - hot pinks, purples, and flashing blues. Her colors reflect chaos, instability, and her fractured mental state. The use of bright, manic colors contrasts her tragic backstory and inner turmoil.</li><br>
                <li><strong>Lighting and Mood:</strong> Key emotional beats (like Vi and Powder's reunion, or Viktor's isolation) are heightened with cold blues or warm ambers depending on the characters' internal experiences. The lighting often becomes an extension of their psychology.</li>
            </ul>
        </div>

        <div class="stage-text">
            <h3 class="caption-title"><strong>Symbolism Through Setting</strong></h3>
            <p>The environments themselves are metaphorical. Locations aren't just backdrops, they embody emotional landscapes.</p>
            <ul><br>
                <li><strong>The Bridge:</strong> The bridge between Piltover and Zaun isn't just physical, it's a symbol of the divide between two worlds. Every time characters cross it, it marks a transformation, betrayal, or escalation.</li><br>
                <li><strong>Silco's Office:</strong> A claustrophobic, dimly lit space surrounded by water and reflections, mirroring his paranoia, secrets, and isolation. The giant statue of Vander submerged below represents how Silco is haunted by the past even as he tries to forge a new future.</li><br>
                <li><strong>The Lab:</strong> Viktor's workspaces starts as hopeful and bright, but as he descends further into Hexcore experimentation, the space becomes darker and colder, mirroring his internal conflict and fading humanity.</li>
            </ul>
        </div>

        <div class="stage-text">
            <h3 class="caption-title"><strong>Character Animation and Body Language</strong></h3>
            <p>One of the most innovative aspects of <em>Arcane's</em> storytelling is its subtle use of body language and facial expression.</p><br>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Jinx's Movements:</strong> Her body language is erratic and unpredictable - twitchy, unbalanced, and childlike one moment, then menacing the next. You can feel her unraveling just by how she moves.</li><br>
                <li><strong>Vi's Facial Expressions:</strong> Vi wears her emotions clearly -her eyes widen in anger, her fists clench in rage, her shoulders slump in grief. She's a character who acts first and thinks later, and her body always reflects her inner conflict.</li><br>
                <li><strong>Mel Medarda's Poise:</strong> Mel's calm, deliberate movements and perfectly composed posture show the mask she wears in politics. Her composure is part of her armor, a performance in power.</li>
            </ul>
        </div>

        <img src="images/councilorJayce.webp" alt="Image 1">
        <img src="images/silcoShimmer2.gif" alt="Image 2">

        <div class="stage-text">
            <h3 class="caption-title"><strong>Visual Motifs and Recurring Symbols</strong></h3>
            <p>The environments themselves are metaphorical. Locations aren't just backdrops - they embody emotional landscapes.</p><br>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>The Monkey Toy:</strong> Powder's toy monkey becomes one of Jinx's signature weapons - a chilling evolution that symbolizes her shattered innocence and descent into madness. What was once a comfort becomes a tool of destruction.</li><br>
                <li><strong>The Flare:</strong> When Jinx sets off the blue flare Vi gave her as a child, it's more than a signal - it's a cry for help, a desperate plea to be seen and loved as she once was. The flare burning in the smoke filled skyline is one of the show's most heartbreaking images.</li><br>
                <li><strong>Butterflies and Moths:</strong> Associated with transformation and fleeting beauty, butterflies, particularly in Viktor's story, represent mortality, change, and the line between life and death.</li>
            </ul>
        </div>

        <img src="images/councilorJayce.webp" alt="Image 1">

        <div class="stage-text">
            <h3 class="caption-title"><strong>Framing and Composition</strong></h3>
            <p>Every frame in <em>Arcane</em> looks like a painting - and that's intentional. The way characters are framed visually communicates relationships and emotional distance.</p><br>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Isolation Shots:</strong> When a character is emotionally alone, the composition often centers them in wide, empty spaces. This is especially used with Jinx and Viktor to reflect loneliness.</li><br>
                <li><strong>Split Framing:</strong> Scenes with Vi and Jinx often use barriers - gates, windows, or literal split screens - to visually communicate their separation. Even when they're close physically, the frame reminds us they're emotionally worlds apart.</li><br>
                <li><strong>Close Ups in Emotional Climaxes:</strong> The show isn't afraid to zoom in on tears, trembling lips, or a clenched fist - letting us experience the raw emotion without a single word.</li>
            </ul>
