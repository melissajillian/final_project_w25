    <h1 class="analysish1">Class Divide: Piltover vs. Zaun</h1>
    <div class="summary">
        <p>
            Beneath the shining skyline of Piltover lies the suffocating smog of Zaun - two cities stacked atop each other, one thriving, the other barely surviving. <em>Arcane</em> uses this stark divide not just as a backdrop, but as a living, breathing part of its story. It explores how wealth, privilege, and progress are often built on exploitation, and how resentment, revolution, and resistance grow in the shadows of luxury. The tension between Piltover and Zaun isn't just political - it's personal and emotional, with layered dynamics of class, where innovation comes at a cost, and justice is a luxury only some can afford.

            <h3 class="caption-title"><strong>Piltover and Zaun: A World Split in Two</strong></h3>
            <p>At the heart of <em>Arcane</em> lies a city divided - not just by a bridge, but by ideology, power, and privilege. Piltover sits above as a beacon of innovation and prosperity, while Zaun festers below in toxic haze and forgotten streets. The contrast is visually striking and narratively powerful: gleaming towers of Hextech rise high above dark alleys lined with rust, grime, and desperation. Yet these two halves are intrinsically connected. Piltover's golden age is built on the labor, sacrifice, and suffering of Zaunites.</p><br>

            <h3 class="caption-title"><strong>Piltover: Progress Without Accountability</strong></h3>
            <p>Piltover prides itself on order, elegance, and discovery. The ruling council controls the flow of technology and trade, carefully maintaining their power while presenting an image of meritocracy and reason. But <em>Arcane</em> exposes the cracks beneath the polished surface. Jayce's rise shows how quickly idealism can be co-opted by political interest. Caitlyn's journey reveals how blind the elite can be to the suffering of those just beyond their gates. Piltover is not evil, but it is willfully ignorant, upholding a system that benefits the few while silencing the many.</p><br>

            <h3 class="caption-title"><strong>Zaun: Innovation Born from Desperation</strong></h3>
            <p>In Zaun, survival is innovation. Lacking resources and respect, its people turn to whatever means they can - smuggling, scavenging, and experimenting. Shimmer is both a miracle and a curse: a drug that brings strength, but also addiction and destruction. For many Zaunites, there is no choice but to fight - whether through Silco's rebellion, Ekko's Firelights, or Jinx's chaotic retaliation. Zaun isn't just a victim of Piltover's neglect; it's a community of resilience, pain, and fierce determination.</p><br>

            <h3 class="caption-title"><strong>Characters Caught Between Worlds</strong></h3>
            <p>The brilliance of <em>Arcane</em> lies in its characters, many of whom live in the grey space between Piltover and Zaun. Vi and Jinx, born in Zaun, represent the raw humanity of the undercity, shaped by abandonment and struggle. Jayce and Caitlyn, children of privilege, are forced to confront their own complicity in the system. Viktor bridges the gap most literally - a Zaunite who climbs to Piltover's inner circle, only to be disillusioned by its hypocrisy.</p><br>
            <p><strong>Each character asks the same question in their own way, What must be sacrificed to bring change?</strong></p>

        <div class="stage-text">
            <h3 class="caption-title"><strong>Revolution, Resistance, and the Cost of Change</strong></h3>
            <p>Silco's rebellion is brutal and extreme, but the show never treats it as unjustified. He seeks liberation for Zaun, even if it means war. Ekko, in contrast, builds a vision of Zaun based on hope and protection. Meanwhile, Piltover's council debates progress while the city beneath burns. The tension between these visions culminates in chaos, and the show refuses to offer easy answers.</p><br>
            <p><strong>It asks, is peace possible without equality? Can innovation exist without justice?</strong></p>
